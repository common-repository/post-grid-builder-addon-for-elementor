Efficiently Coded

Grid is responsive and the layout can be customized based on the device using the responsive controls. It contains minimal Javascript and CSS files. Everything is minified for better performance. We have not used the Bootstrap!. Actions and filters are provided so that the developer made changes do not conflict with our updates. Just let us know if you need a filter!. We have plans to add AJAX features but it can become laggy if a user has 100+ posts. Let us know if you need the feature we will plan asap!

Custom backend/frontend filtering and ordering

We have added support for most types of ordering the WordPress API provides. A custom tax-query builder is also provided. Order it the way you like. How about a front end sort and filter builder? We have not hardcoded anything we allow you to build the way you like it. You can add select or list layout. Allows users to sort and filter the posts by category, tags or even custom taxonomies!. Options are available to display ACF relational posts.
